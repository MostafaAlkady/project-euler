# My Project Euler Solutions (incomplete)
Project-Euler is a website that contains challenging mathematics problems that require more than mathematical insight. Brute force solutions will almost always fail, and problems can only be solved using an optimized code. This is a repository for my solutions of some of Project Euler problems using Python. Some of these problems took me days to come up with the idea.

Remember: Cheating is totally pointless. Please think about the problems yourself first, however long it might take you.
