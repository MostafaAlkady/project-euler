# My Project Euler Solutions (incomplete)
Project-Euler is a website that contains <p style="color:red;">challenging</p> mathematics problems that require more than mathematical insight. Brute force solutions will almost always fail, and problems can only be solved using an optimized code. This is a repository for my solutions of some of Project Euler problems using Python. Some of the advanced problems took me days to come up with the idea.

Remember: Cheating is totally pointless. Please think about the problems yourself first, however long it might take you.
