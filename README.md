# My Project Euler Solutions
<a href="https://projecteuler.net/">Project-Euler</a> is a website that contains challenging mathematics problems that require more than mathematical insight. Brute force solutions will almost always fail, and problems can only be solved using an optimized code. This is a repository for my solutions of some of Project Euler problems using Python. Some of the advanced problems took me days to come up with the idea.

As per Project Euler's rules, the codes for problems 1-100 will be available in the designated folder. However, problems in 100-900 will be available upon request.

I quote from the website:
"However, the rule about sharing solutions outside of Project Euler does not apply to the first one-hundred problems, as long as any discussion clearly aims to instruct methods, not just provide answers, and does not directly threaten to undermine the enjoyment of solving later problems. Problems 1 to 100 provide a wealth of helpful introductory teaching material and if you are able to respect our requirements, then we give permission for those problems and their solutions to be discussed elsewhere."

Remember: Cheating defies the point of learning. Please think about the problems yourself first, however long it might take you.
